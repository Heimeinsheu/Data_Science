This repository have some projects related to data science. Applying different mmethod like machine learnng, deep learning, genetic algorithm etc.

## Software Defects
Software Engineering is a comprehensive domain since it requires a tight communication between system stakeholders and delivering the system to be developed within a determinate time and a limited budget. Delivering the customer requirements include procuring high performance by minimizing the system. Thanks to effective prediction of system defects on the front line of the project life cycle, the projectâ€™s resources and the effort or the software developers can be allocated more efficiently for system development and quality assurance activities. The main aim of this paper is to evaluate the capability of machine learning algorithms in software defect prediction and find the best category while comparing five machine learning algorithms within the context of five NASA datasets obtained from public PROMISE repository and five more datasets from other sources .
